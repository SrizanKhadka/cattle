Docker Compose Commands and Their Explanations
===============================================

1. docker-compose up
   - Purpose: Builds, creates, starts, and attaches to containers for all services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
   - Example:
     docker-compose up
   - Flags:
     - -d: Runs containers in detached mode (in the background).
       docker-compose up -d

2. docker-compose down
   - Purpose: Stops and removes containers, networks, and volumes created by `docker-compose up`.
   - Example:
     docker-compose down
   - Flags:
     - -v: Removes named volumes declared in the `volumes` section.
       docker-compose down -v

3. docker-compose build
   - Purpose: Builds or rebuilds the Docker images specified in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
   - Example:
     docker-compose build
   - Flags:
     - --no-cache: Builds the images without using cache for a fresh build.
       docker-compose build --no-cache

4. docker-compose start
   - Purpose: Starts services that have already been created but does not recreate them.
   - Example:
     docker-compose start

5. docker-compose stop
   - Purpose: Stops running containers but does not remove them.
   - Example:
     docker-compose stop

6. docker-compose ps
   - Purpose: Lists containers managed by Docker Compose and their statuses.
   - Example:
     docker-compose ps

7. docker-compose exec
   - Purpose: Executes a command inside a running container.
   - Example:
     docker-compose exec <service_name> <command>
   - Example Usage:
     - Running a shell inside the `web` service:
       docker-compose exec web bash

8. docker-compose logs
   - Purpose: Displays logs for the services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
   - Example:
     docker-compose logs
   - Flags:
     - -f: Follows log output (real-time logs).
       docker-compose logs -f

9. docker-compose config
   - Purpose: Validates and displays the configuration of the `docker-compose.yml` file.
   - Example:
     docker-compose config

10. docker-compose rm
    - Purpose: Removes stopped service containers. Itâ€™s useful for cleanup after `docker-compose stop`.
    - Example:
      docker-compose rm
    - Flags:
      - -f: Force removal without confirmation.
        docker-compose rm -f

11. docker-compose restart
    - Purpose: Restarts all the services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
    - Example:
      docker-compose restart

12. docker-compose pull
    - Purpose: Pulls images for services from a Docker registry (e.g., Docker Hub).
    - Example:
      docker-compose pull

13. docker-compose scale
    - Purpose: Scales a specific service to the specified number of instances.
    - Example:
      docker-compose scale web=3
    - Note: Deprecated in favor of `docker-compose up --scale`.

14. docker-compose version
    - Purpose: Displays the Docker Compose version installed on your system.
    - Example:
      docker-compose version

15. docker-compose run
    - Purpose: Runs a one-off command for a service (creates a new container, unlike `exec`).
    - Example:
      docker-compose run <service_name> <command>
    - Example Usage:
      - Running a Django management command:
        docker-compose run web python manage.py migrate
